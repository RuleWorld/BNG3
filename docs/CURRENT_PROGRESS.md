# BNG3 current progress

**Audited:** 2026-09-15
**Repository:** `RuleWorld/BNG3`
**Branch:** `codex/bng3-status-docs-20260915`
**Status:** implementation and validation checkpoint; convergence and release remain incomplete

This is the live status page for the combined BNG3 migration tree. The older
IR migration reports and formalization reports retained in the repository are
historical inputs and provenance records; their embedded prose is not a new
execution instruction.

## Imported material

The cumulative import retained the three supplied snapshots, with the
2026-09-14 source tree taking precedence where snapshots overlap:

- `BNG3-Lean-formalization-latest.zip` — SHA-256
  `460f89c4380bde3a6f52377397d32ca098efc19c8fdbf675eeac33aa6bb5d530`
- `BNG3-ir-migration-everything-so-far-2026-09-11.zip` — SHA-256
  `31342054fc902b7ed3777be799a9a5d6dc5c5534ff3aa27afe8f6f556156e5e7`
- `BNG3-ir-migration-current-2026-09-14.zip` — SHA-256
  `523219fa6cd05928830482d74e88633a44cf2f53e6944c1fc72cd144229bfbac`

Archive reports, source locks, manifests, and provenance records remain in
place. Generated Lean build output is not part of the import.

## Full-corpus CI, Windows compatibility, and repository-organization checkpoint — 2026-09-15

Semantic validation repair commit `78a1591422ccbe6c4a5607eb748b426bbdbc303f`
and final documentation/Windows repair commit
`ed4c59e028b2799a7b8025a8b37dccdc1dec0888` are published on PR #10. The
checkpoint closes the former full-corpus
reference exclusions: independent BNG2 `.net` references now cover the
previously missing network fixtures, and
`tests/validation/validation_manifest.json` routes the six action-focused
fixtures through explicit output contracts in `scripts/validate_actions.py`.
The native reader also has a narrow, fail-closed legacy structured-SBML
`atomize=>1` contract for the `plain2` fixture, and reverse local-rate scope is
preserved during rule expansion.

The live local evidence for that semantic commit is:

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Native CTest | `308/308` passed |
| Full validation corpus | `71 passed, 0 failed, 0 errors, 0 skipped` |
| Action-output contracts | `6/6` passed |
| CI-contract tests | `26 passed` |
| Energy Python tests | `66 passed` |
| Black, Ruff, corpus, provenance, and exception-ledger checks | passed |

The former exclusion ledger is closed with empty PR and weekly profiles. The
historical migration reports and text metadata are organized under
[`archive/reports/ir-migration-2026-09-14/`](archive/reports/ir-migration-2026-09-14/);
obsolete patch snapshots and duplicate package wrappers were removed after
their changes were applied. Handoff documents remain historical provenance,
while this page and the convergence checklist are the live status sources.

The exact-head hosted CI run
[`34896645707`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNG3/actions/runs/34896645707)
completed successfully, including the Windows/MSVC matrix, full corpus on
Ubuntu/macOS/Windows, package smoke, and integration tests. Cross-tool parity,
Lean, CodeQL, and formatting runs also completed successfully. The preceding
hosted head exposed a
Windows/MSVC-only ANTLR failure: `NFinput.cpp` could enter the runtime through
generated visitor headers before the translation-unit compatibility include.
Those generated headers now include `parser/antlr_compat.hpp` themselves, and
the current local rebuild passes. The scheduled NFsim historical job and
release-only artifact/publish jobs are conditionally skipped by their event
guards; the full validation corpus has no skipped fixtures and the exclusion
ledger is empty. Broader backend equivalence, release qualification, and
convergence are still incomplete.

## Wheel CI repair checkpoint — 2026-09-15

The main push run
[`34901298982`](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNG3/actions/runs/34901298982)
exposed two independent wheel-environment failures. The macOS x86_64 build
used deployment target 10.9, which is below the macOS availability of the
ANTLR runtime's `std::optional::value()` and `std::shared_mutex` usage. The
manylinux2014 wheel test resolved NumPy 2.5.3 from source, where the image's
GCC 10.2.1 is below NumPy's GCC 10.3 minimum; no compatible manylinux2014
binary was available for that target.

The follow-up repairs both `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and
`.github/workflows/release.yml`: cibuildwheel is pinned to 4.2.1, macOS
builders use their native runner architecture with deployment targets 10.13
(macos-13/x86_64) and 11.0 (macos-14/arm64), and Linux wheels use
`manylinux_2_28` so current NumPy test dependencies resolve to binary wheels.
The CI workflow also exposes a manual-dispatch path for the wheel matrix so
this repair can be validated on the exact follow-up head before release
qualification. The hosted rerun is pending; this checkpoint makes no wheel
or release-success claim until every matrix job is terminal-success.

## Repairs in this checkpoint

- Retain the lowering context owned by generated native graphs so graph node
  and state-type references remain valid after network generation returns.
- Parse native unbound markers and preserve NFcore2 equivalent-component
  reaction-center semantics.
- Repair compiled NFsim handling for dynamic expressions, time and reactant
  references, function dependencies, reversible Arrhenius/function-product
  rates, and symmetric molecule-observable embeddings.
- Preserve model-defined `_Na` parameters at the compiled NFsim boundary so
  direct AST construction and the XML compatibility path use identical values.
- Repair ODE observable references in functional rates and add a pinned PR
  workflow for Lean kernel, smoke, and NFnext contract checks.
- Preserve reverse-direction local-rate scope and accept legacy action argument
  lists for hybrid, visualization, and network-writing actions.
- Close the validation exclusions with independent network references and
  explicit action-output contracts; remove the old skip arguments from PR and
  weekly validation jobs.
- Apply the Windows SDK macro compatibility guard to every generated ANTLR
  parser/visitor header, covering direct include paths used by the legacy NFsim
  adapter as well as the modern parser targets.

## Verified gates

| Gate | Current evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Native CTest | `308/308` passed after the current rebuild |
| Python package tests | `399 passed, 28 skipped` excluding SBML import; isolated SBML test `1 passed` |
| Validation smoke | `4 passed, 14 skipped, 178 deselected`; skips are explicit environment/reference conditions |
| Export validation | `12 passed, 184 deselected` |
| BNG2 structural differential | `5/5` selected models passed against locked source revision `e0a5c6d9e6c4730f66102e48d0d0a598337083e7` |
| BNG2 broad validation subset | `11 passed, 89 skipped, 96 deselected`; this is not full Tier-P qualification |
| Full validation corpus | `71/71` passed with `0` failures, `0` errors, and `0` skips |
| Explicit action-output validation | `6/6` passed for the former action-focused exclusions |
| NFsim direct/XML | `10 passed` for the selected independent NFsim gate: four direct/XML checks, four 200-run ensemble comparisons, and two fixed-seed endpoint checks |
| Lean/NFnext local checks | static validation `36` files, NFnext contracts `18/18`; local kernel check unavailable because `lean`, `lake`, and `elan` are not installed |
| Provenance/corpus/ledger | provenance validation, corpus validation/generation check, and zero-active-exception ledger all pass |

The independent NFsim oracle is built from source revision
`a6f9fa945c9d6e1e122e789c952260112c93f157`, binary SHA-256
`c0974ad71a88938ed3f2ed096878d53aec14e946c91e28e1bc644759db1da3b4`.
The independent BNG2 source revision used for the structural subset is
`e0a5c6d9e6c4730f66102e48d0d0a598337083e7`.

These results are exact-head evidence for the listed fixtures and commands.
They do not establish complete corpus parity, backend equivalence, release
readiness, or convergence.

## Remaining plan of action

1. Expand the independent BNG2/NFsim differential matrices over the locked
   corpus, replacing environment-induced skips with runnable oracle coverage
   where possible and recording any maintainer-approved dispositions.
2. Continue the direct NFsim adapter audit for dynamic rates/functions, energy,
   observables, population maps, and unsupported constructs; add a focused
   fixture and oracle result for each newly supported semantic slice.
3. Triage remaining native/Python/parity gaps by source-integration failure
   versus semantic mismatch, preserving fail-closed behavior and the current
   exception ledger.
4. Connect the typed Lean reference to a small real C++/NFIR lowering slice,
   then promote NFnext contracts only after backend-equivalence evidence exists.
5. Run the manual-dispatch wheel matrix on the exact follow-up head, then
   rerun clean native, Python, oracle, formal, packaging, and release gates
   before any convergence or release claim.
